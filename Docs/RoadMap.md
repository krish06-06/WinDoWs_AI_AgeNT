# 🗺️ Project Roadmap: OS-Agent (Windows + Linux)

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Develop a **high-performance, privacy-first AI Agent** capable of full OS automation and reasoning, with **100% offline "Zero-Trust" execution** on both Windows and Linux (NixOS/GNOME). Users retain full control over data and hardware.
